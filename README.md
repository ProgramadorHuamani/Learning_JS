# Learning about JavaScript book from beginner to professional ðŸ“’

Through this book from the **"Packt"** publishing house, I will embark on my path to learn JavaScript to use it in the creation of my first portfolio as well as other future projects in the web environment.

As I progress with each chapter, I will post a brief summary of what it is about and a brief opinion on how it went.

The idea is that this repository can be seen by other people so that they can start this great adventure and discover the wonders of learning new technologies.

Fasten your seatbelt, the journey begins now!
